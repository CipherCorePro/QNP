## Introduction

Quantum-NeuroPersona is an experimental, trainable Quantum Large Language Model (QLLM) based on a modular network of Quantum Node Systems (QNS). Each QNS uses parameterized quantum circuits (PQC) for state modulation with 2 qubits per node. Training occurs via a combination of smoothed, quantum-modulated Hebbian learning and novel, state-dependent control strategies. This analysis evaluates the learning progress and system behavior during the first six training epochs. Particular focus is placed on the influence of the implemented "Peak Loss Persistence" strategy and the system's response to dynamic changes in the data stream with a base shot count of n=30.

## Methodology

### Network Architecture & Learning Mechanisms

The model consists of 12 nodes (including specialized modules such as `Limbus Affektus`, `Meta Cognitio`, `Cortex Criticus`, and Memory/Value nodes), each operating **with 2 qubits** (see Figure 3 - *Note: Figure 3 not provided in source*). The primary learning rule is a **smoothed Hebbian rule** that adjusts both classical connection weights and quantum parameters (RY rotations) of the presynaptic node. The activations used for the rule are averaged over a short time window (3 steps). The quantum learning rate (`lr_q`) is additionally dynamically modulated by a **Jump Boost mechanism**: Detected "jumps" in the measured state of a quantum node – an indicator of the intended high state dynamics – **actively and specifically increase** `lr_q`, while the absence of jumps slightly dampens it.

### Control Strategies

Several experimental strategies control the global learning behavior:

1.  **Randomized Shots (Initial Phase):** In the first epoch, the effective shot count per chunk was slightly randomized (30 +/- 1-2 shots) to encourage initial exploration.
2.  **Peak Loss Persistence (Active from E2):** If the average loss (`avg_loss`) at the end of an epoch reaches a new peak value (`highest_loss_recorded`), a persistence mode is activated. In this mode, all *other* adaptive control strategies (dynamic shot adjustment, parameter perturbation, variance trigger) are **paused** for the following epochs. Persistence is only *lifted* when an epoch ends with an `avg_loss` that is *higher* than the value that originally triggered the persistence (`loss_at_last_peak`).
3.  **Dynamic Shots (Paused E2-E6):** Normally adjusted based on stagnation or inactivity. Deactivated by persistence.
4.  **Parameter Perturbation (Paused E2-E6):** Normally perturbation during stagnation. Deactivated by persistence.
5.  **Variance Trigger (Paused E2-E6):** Normally increases shots on low variance. Deactivated by persistence.

### Training Data & Processing

Three text sources (`sample1.txt`, `ethics_ai.md`, `philosophy_basics.txt`) were used. The file `philosophy_basics.txt` was unavailable during Epoch 2 and was only provided to the system at the beginning of Epoch 3. The `DatasetLoader`, which re-reads the source files at the beginning of *each* epoch, segments the texts into chunks. This design enabled the **seamless dynamic integration of new data *during* ongoing training without interruption or restart**. This represents a significant deviation from standard LLM training pipelines and demonstrates an inherent capability for online adaptation.

## Results & Analysis

### Figure 1: Loss Curve Over Epochs

![alt text](epochen_verlauf.png)
> The average loss shows a clear trend: After the initial value of 0.346 in Epoch 1 (which set the `highest_loss_recorded` and triggered persistence), it dropped significantly to 0.334 **despite the integration of new data in Epoch 3**. In Epochs 4-6, the loss stabilized or oscillated slightly in this lower range (0.334-0.335). Since the loss never exceeded the initial peak, peak loss persistence remained active throughout the observed period (E2-E6).

### Internal Dynamics: Node Activities and Connection Strengths

**Checkpoint Data & Plots (Fig. 4 & 5 - *Note: Figures 4 & 5 not provided in source*):** Analyses of the checkpoints and the aggregated plots show high internal dynamics:

*   **Fluctuating Top Nodes:** Nodes with the highest activation changed significantly from epoch to epoch (see Table 1 & Plot 4). At the end of Epoch 6, the memory nodes (`Ethics`, `Consciousness`, `Philosophy`) and value nodes (`Goal_Rationality`, `Goal_Empathy`) dominated, indicating a developing focus within the network.
*   **Active Hebbian Learning:** The strengths of the Hebbian connections changed continuously (Plot 5, Table 1), demonstrating the activity of the learning rule. Prominent connections (`Limbus Affektus -> Cortex Criticus`, `Ethics -> Cortex Criticus`, `Philosophy -> Meta Cognitio`) suggest the establishment of meaningful contextual links.
*   **Effectiveness during Persistence & Data Integration:** The significant loss drop in Epoch 3, even though adaptive controls were paused **and new data was being processed**, underscores the effectiveness and robustness of the (jump-boosted) Hebbian rule as the primary optimization driver.
*   **Capability for Online Adaptation:** The system integrated the chunks from the newly available file `philosophy_basics.txt` starting from Epoch 3 without instability and was still able to further reduce the loss. This demonstrates a remarkable ability for **continuous adaptation to changing data streams**, which is not readily available in conventional models.

**Table 1: Selected Epoch Data**

### Figure 2: Emotional State (Snapshot End of E6)

![alt text](emotion_state.png)
> The emotional state at the end of Epoch 6 shows **high Arousal** (~0.58), correlating with the high, jump-driven internal dynamics. **Pleasure** is moderately positive (~0.28). **Dominance** is low (~0.1). Overall, a relatively stable but active emotional profile.

## Discussion: Control and Learning in a Dynamic Quantum Regime

The results demonstrate the successful application of the "Peak Loss Persistence" strategy. It "holds" global control parameters fixed once a significant loss peak has been reached, thus filtering out smaller fluctuations at the macro level instead of reacting to every signal in the noise.

This approach makes it possible **to work *with* the high state dynamics, rather than just suppressing them**. The observed 100% jump rate is an expected characteristic in this 2-qubit system with 30 shots. Crucially, this high dynamic is **actively used as a learning signal via the Jump Boost mechanism** to modulate the quantum learning rate. So the system learns not *despite*, but *with the help of* these fluctuations.

At the same time, the **decreasing loss during the persistence phase** (especially in E3) shows that the local, bio-inspired learning mechanisms (smoothed Hebbian learning) are robust enough to achieve optimization progress even without global adaptive control.

The capability for **seamless online integration of new data** underscores the flexibility of the architecture. Unlike static training pipelines, Quantum-NeuroPersona can react to changes in the data stream, which is an important feature for continuous learning. It is as if the rider on the "jittery light beam" can not only maintain balance but also recognize new landscapes (data) along the way and integrate them into their journey.

## Conclusion & Outlook

Quantum-NeuroPersona V1.1 demonstrates promising and unique results in the first 6 training epochs:

*   A stable learning process with **consistent reduction of the average loss**.
*   The successful implementation and application of the novel **Peak Loss Persistence** strategy for controlling global adaptations.
*   The **effectiveness of the smoothed, quantum-modulated Hebbian learning** as the driving force of optimization, which utilizes the high state dynamics via the Jump Boost.
*   **Remarkable robustness and ability for dynamic integration of new data** during ongoing training, which indicates potential for **continuous learning**.
*   High **internal dynamics** alongside a stable emotional profile.

The system exhibits a form of **state-based meta-learning** and an unexpected suitability for **online data integration**. The approach of accepting high state fluctuations as part of the design and actively incorporating them into the learning rules represents a significant departure from traditional optimization strategies.

Future work includes longer training runs to observe the long-term behavior of persistence, more detailed analyses of quantum parameter evolution, as well as the **systematic investigation of how the interplay between qubit count, shot count, and the control strategies can further optimize the intended, jump-driven learning dynamics. The current results with 2 qubits and 30 shots suggest that stability and learning are achievable even in a highly dynamic regime, if the learning and control mechanisms are designed accordingly.**
